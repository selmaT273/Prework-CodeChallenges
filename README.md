## Problem 1 
### Problem Statement
Given an array select a number that exists, and output the computated "score". The method you create should take in both an array of integers and the integer the user selected.

Create a Console application that requests 5 numbers between 1-10 from the user. Output the array to the console and ask the user to select a number. After the selection, output the "score" of the number chosen.

### Selection and Scoring Algorithm
You can select any number from the list, however your scoring will be depend on the frequency of that number in the list. E.g for [2,2,3,5,4] if you pick 2 your score will be 4 (2 * 2) but if you pick 5 your score will be 5 (5 * 1)
